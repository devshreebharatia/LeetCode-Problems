Basic Formula for conversion:

If we want to convert a string into integer, there are two ways:
    a. String is "123", then int ans = '1'-'0'OR '2'-'0' OR '3'-'0' and so on...
    b. String is "abc", then int ans = 'a'-'a' OR 'b'-'a' OR 'c'-'a' and so on...

If we want to convert an integer into string, there are two ways:
    a. integer is 123, then string ans += 1 + 'a'
