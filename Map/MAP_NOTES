Two Types of Maps:

   		| map                 | unordered_map
---------------------------------------------------------
Ordering        | increasing  order   | no ordering
                | (by default)        |

Implementation  | Self balancing BST  | Hash Table
                | like Red-Black Tree |  

search time     | log(n)              | O(1) -> Average 
                |                     | O(n) -> Worst Case

Insertion time  | log(n) + Rebalance  | Same as search
                      
Deletion time   | log(n) + Rebalance  | Same as search


NOTE: In case you insert the elements in any order, but you want them to be stored and retrieved in a ordered manner, then use maps.
Else only for temporary storage purposes always prefer unordered maps.
