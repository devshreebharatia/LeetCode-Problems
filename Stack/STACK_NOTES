TRICKS:

Depth First Search and Breadth First Search
DFS is implemented using stack whereas BFS is implemented using queue
In DFS: If the current node does not have any child nodes/ the child/adjacent nodes have been visited,
pop the element. It uses recursion. It is used for problems like reaching a specific goal/ sinking the
co-ordinate etc. Low memory requirements.

In BFS: If both the child nodes of the current nodes have been enqueued into the queue then dequeue
the current node. It never uses recursion. It is used for problems like finding shortest path.
High memory requirements.

Same space and Time complexities for both:
Space Complexity: O(|V|)
Time Complexity: O(|V| + |E|)
